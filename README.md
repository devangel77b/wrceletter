# wrceletter
### D Evangelista
Letterhead format for US Naval Academy Dept of Weapons, Robotics, and Control Engineering. 

## How to get this package
Clone the repository into your `texmf` tree. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devangel77b/wrceletter
```
On Ubuntu machines, your `texmf` is typically within your home directory (usually `/home/username/texmf`). The files should probably go within `~/texmf/tex/latex` somehwere). 

On Windows machines using Miktex I usually put the files in a `texmf` tree under `This PC > Documents` for example. 

## Examples
See the examples using `\documentclass{wrceletter}`, which is derived from `\documentclass{letter}`.
